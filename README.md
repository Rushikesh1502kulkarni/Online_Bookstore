In this projects, we tried to create a mini Website for Book Store using Html, 
CSS & Bootstrap. The motive of this website is users should able to read their favorite books by 
buying those books online. For this, here we have created two sections in which the first section 
contains popular book and in the other section we recommended books to the user.
Users can go through these sections and click on the read now button to read the 
introduction of the book. Also, users can buy the books by clicking the buy now button.
By Clicking on the “Back” button user can return to the Home Page.
